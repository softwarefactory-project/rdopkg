      "message": "Well why put custom string into .spec when not needed? By convention, patches_base \u003d Version so that string isn\u0027t needed unless it differs from Version tag or there are skipped patches in which case, patches_base\u003d+N is sufficient.\n\nWhat would be advantages of always having patches_base\u003d1.2.3?",
