      "message": "Not found of the code duplication, but I have no better solution.\nI was thinking about replacing the boolean by a function which solves duplication, so default would be identity function (no normalization).\nPros: if we change normalization, it happens in one place\nCons: API is slightly less nicer, but mitigation would be providing a method with different default (using functools.partial)\n\nThis is just me thinking aloud, not really a request.",

I was considering creating a local function in get_requires but it was harder to read.\n\nSimilarly, putting the duplicated strings into a variable made it significantly less readable so I allowed this redundancy as an exception :)",

Now, you grep normalize_py23 and immediately see what it does without having to search for a wrapper function that actually contains a single line.\n\nIf I\u0027m ever to touch this code, I promise to move it to a sub-function but I don\u0027t think anyone will ever change this regex while I think someone might actually try to read it.",
