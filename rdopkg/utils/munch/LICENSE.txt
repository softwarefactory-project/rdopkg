This directory is a direct copy of munch software from:

https://github.com/Infinidat/munch

It is included due to complicated packaging situation regarding bunch/munch
libraries on py2/py3.

TODO: Once python2 finally dies and python3-munch is available on Fedora/EPEL,
this code can be dropped in favor of normal dependency.
