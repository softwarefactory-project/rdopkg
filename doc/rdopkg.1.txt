NAME
----
rdopkg - RDO packaging tool


SYNOPSIS
--------

`rdopkg` <action> <arg>...

`rdopkg` `-c`

`rdopkg` `-h`


DESCRIPTION
-----------
**rdopkg** is a tool for automating RDO/RHOSP packaging tasks, such as
introducing patches, updating packages to new versions and submitting
packages to RDO.

Run `rdopkg -h` to get available actions.

persistence
~~~~~~~~~~~

`rdopkg` provides multi-step actions where each step is (should be) idempotent
so if something fails along the way or human interaction is required, rdopkg
drops to shell, let's you rectify and then continue by running
`rdopkg --continue` (`rdopkg -c`).

The state is stored in `.rdopkg.json` file in current directory. Stored action
can be inspected (`rdopkg status`), continued (`rdopkg --continue`) or aborted
(`rdopkg --abort`). `rdopkg` will refuse to start new multi-step action if
state file is present.

      +-----+     +-------+    +-------------+    +--------+

ACTION: fix
~~~~~~~~~~~

Make `.spec` file only changes.

*Flow:*

  * Bump Release, prepare a new %changelog entry header.
  * Drop to shell, let user edit .spec file.
  * After running `rdopkg`, ensure description was added to %changelog
    and commit changes to new commit.

*Example:*
    
    cd python-novaclient
    rdopkg fix
    vim python-novaclient.spec
    rdopkg -c

ACTION: patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduce new patches to the package.

This action works with patches branch
(see <<patches-branch,AUTOMAGIC -> patches branch>>).
By default, `rdopkg` resets local patches branch to remote patches branch.
You can skip this this with `--local-patches` to directly use local patches
branch as is.

Note that `patch` is a high level wrapper of `update-patches` action. If
you're interested in just updating patches in `.spec` file from local patches
branch, try using `update-patches` action instead.

Don't forget to `git fetch` before running the action.

After running `rdopkg patch`, new commit will contain the changes.

*Flow:*

  * Unless `-l`/`--local-patches` was used, reset local patches branch to
    remote patches branch.
  * Update .spec file: bump Release, create new %changelog entry with new
    patches' titles and create a commit.
  * Update patches from local patches branch (`update-patches` action)
  * Display the diff.

ACTION: new-version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update package to new upstream version.

This action works with patches branch 
(see <<patches-branch,AUTOMAGIC -> patches branch>>).
After successful rebase, `rdopkg` will offer to push the
rebased patches branch.

Required `new-version` argument is a new version to rebase on, presumably
a git version tag.

Don't forget to `git fetch --all` before running the action.

After running `rdopkg new-version`, new commit will contain the changes.

To just update `.spec` without touching patches branch, `-b`/`--bump-only` can
be used. You might also occasionally want to skip `fedpkg new-sources` step
with `-n`/`--no-new-sources`. These two options combined give you local-only
operation, much like `rpmdev-bumpspec`:

    rdopkg -bn

*Flow:*

  * Show diff from previous version, especially changes to `requirements.txt`.
  * Reset local patches branch to remote patches branch
  * Rebase local patches branch on `$NEW_VERSION` tag.
  * Update `.spec` file: set `Version`, `Release` and `patches_base` to
    appropriate values and create new %changelog entry.
  * Download source tarball.
  * Run `fedpkg new-sources` (`rhpkg new-sources`).
  * Update patches from local patches branch (`update-patches` action)
  * Display the diff.

*Example:*

    cd python-novaclient
    git fetch --all
    rdopkg new-version 2.15.0
    # rebase failed, manually fix using git
    rdopkg -c
    

ACTION: update-patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update `.spec` file with patches from patches branch.

This is a core low level action used by other actions such as `patch` and
`new-version` to update dist-git patches from patches branch. 
See <<patches-branch,AUTOMAGIC -> patches branch>> for explanation.

`update-patches` is a rework of now obsolete `update-patches.sh` script with
less restrictions and more features such as optional #patches_base, support
for `git am %{patches}` method of applying patches and smart patches branch
detection. It also supports filtering out patches based on matching a
regex provided by a magic #patches_ignore comment in the spec file. This is
useful, for example, in case the patches branch contains changes that are
related to the CI/code review infra, that are useful to keep around but don't
need to end up in the RPM.

*Flow:*

 * Export patches from patches branch using `git format-patch`
 * Add these patches to dist-git and edit `.spec` file to apply them
 * Create new commit with the change (or amend previous with `-a`/`--amend`)
 * If a "%global commit asdf1234" macro declaration is present, rewrite
   it with the current sha1 of the patches branch. (This makes the sha1
   value available during your package's build process. You can use this
   to build your program so that "mycoolprogram --version" could display
   the sha1 to users.)

*Example:*

    rdopkg update-patches


ACTION: query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query RDO/distro repos for available package versions.

See link:rdopkg-adv-requirements.7.html[rdopkg-adv-requirements(7)] for
complete example of `query` and other requirements management actions.

This action uses `repoquery` to discover latest package versions available
from RDO and other repos available on a supported distibution.

See output of `rdopkg info` for supported releases and distros.

*Query specific RELEASE/DIST:*

     rdopkg query kilo/el7 openstack-nova

*Query all dists of a release and show what's happening:*

     rdopkg query -v kilo openstack-nova


ACTION: reqquery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query RDO/distro repos for versions defined in requirements.txt.

See link:rdopkg-adv-requirements.7.html[rdopkg-adv-requirements(7)] for
complete example of `reqquery` and other requirements management actions.

This action essentially runs `rdopkg query` on every module/package defined in
`requirements.txt` and prints colorful report to quickly find unmet
dependencies. It accepts the same RELEAESE/DIST filter as `rdopkg query`.

Python module names listed in `requirements.txt` are mapped to package names
using `rdopkg.actionmods.pymod2pkg` module.

*Query `requirements.txt` from `2015.1` tag:*

    rdopkg reqquery -R 2015.1 kilo/el7

*Query `requirements.txt` file:*

    rdopkg reqquery -r path/to/requirements.txt kilo/f21

*Query `.spec` Requires (experimental):*

    rdopkg reqquery -s

*Verbosely dump query results to a file and view them:*

    rdopkg reqquery -v -d
    rdopkg reqquery -l


ACTION: reqcheck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inspect `requirements.txt` vs `.spec` Requires.

See link:rdopkg-adv-requirements.7.html[rdopkg-adv-requirements(7)] for
complete example of `reqcheck` and other requirements management actions.

This action parses current `requirements.txt` from git and checks whether
they're met in the `.spec` file. Simple report is printed.

Python module names listed in `requirements.txt` are mapped to package names
using `rdopkg.actionmods.pymod2pkg` module.

NOTE: Checking for exact version ranges is dumb at the moment.

*Example:*

    rdopkg reqcheck


ACTION: reqdiff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Show pretty diff of `requirements.txt`.

See link:rdopkg-adv-requirements.7.html[rdopkg-adv-requirements(7)] for
complete example of `reqdiff` and other requirements management actions.

Use this to see how requirements changed between versions.

*See diff between current and latest upstream version (automagic):*

    rdopkg reqdiff

*See diff between current and specified version:*

    rdopkg reqdiff 2015.1

*See diff between two supplied versions:*

    rdopkg reqdiff 2015.1 2015.2


ACTION: kojibuild
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build the package in `koji`.

See link:rdopkg-adv-building.7.html[rdopkg-adv-building(7)] for complete
example of building and submitting packages for RDO.

This is esentaially a wrapper over `fedpkg build` with added value of
generating update entries for `rdopkg update`.

By default, build is appended to `up.yml` update file (new one is created if
needed) which is then used by `rdopkg update` to submit builds to RDO.
Use `-f/--update-file` to specify different file or `-F/--no-update-file` to
disable this.

*Flow:*

 * Run equivalent of `fedpkg build` using disgusting `fedpkg` python module.
 * Watch the build.
 * Print `rdopkg update` entry for the build and dump it to `up.yml`.

*Example:*

    rdopkg kojibuild


ACTION: coprbuild
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build the package in `copr-jruzicka`.

See link:rdopkg-adv-building.7.html[rdopkg-adv-building(7)] for complete
example including instructions how to setup copr, obtain permissions, build,
submit update, and more.

**Please**, try to do `coprbuild` after successful `kojibuild` to ensure same
SRPM for both builds. This will be automated further in the future.

`-r/--release` and `-d/--dist` are autodetected from current branch if
possible. These are used to select right copr to build in.

By default, build is appended to `up.yml` update file (new one is created if
needed) which is then used by `rdopkg update` to submit builds to RDO.
Use `-f/--update-file` to specify different file or `-F/--no-update-file` to
disable this.

*Flow:*

 * Create the source RPM from current dist-git.
 * Upload the source RPM to your `fedorapeople.org:~/public_html/copr`.
   (specify Fedora user with `-u/--fuser`)
 * Submit the source RPM to build in `jruzicka / rdo-$RELEASE-$DIST` copr.
 * Watch the build.
 * Print `rdopkg update` entry for the build and dump it to `up.yml`.

*Example:*

    rdopkg coprbuild


ACTION: update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submit updated packages into RDO.

See link:rdopkg-adv-building.7.html[rdopkg-adv-building(7)] for complete
example of building and submitting packages for RDO.

This command expects special update file as its optional argument which
defaults to `up.yml`. `rdopkg kojibuild` and `rdopkg coprbuild` automatically
generate this file, you only need to provide description of the update in
`notes:` field.

`rdopkg` validates the update using `rdoinfo`, checks the availability of
builds in respective build sources, submits the update for review into
`rdo-update` repository, and *deletes* the local update file (only in case of
default `up.yml`) so that next `kojibuild`/`coprbuild` start with fresh update
file. This way, no action parameters or file manipulations are required.

Note that `kojibuild` and `coprbuild` actions support `-s/--skip-build`
argument which can be used to generate update file without triggering the
build (i.e. after the builds are done manually).

**Example update file:**

    notes: |-
      Latest upstream python-swiftclient-1.2.3 for RDO Juno
      Fixes rhbz#1234567
    builds:
    - id: python-swiftclient-1.2.3-1.fc22
      source: koji
      repo: juno
      dist: fedora-21
    - id: python-swiftclient-1.2.3-1.el7
      source: copr-jruzicka
      repo: juno
      dist: epel-7

**Juno example:**

    rdopkg kojibuild
    rdopkg coprbuild
    rdopkg update

**Icehouse example:**

    rdopkg kojibuild
    rdopkg coprbuild -d epel-6
    rdopkg coprbuild -d epel-7
    rdopkg update

ACTION: amend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amend last git commit with current dist-git changes and (re)generate the commit
message from %changelog.

This simple atomic action is equivalent to running

    git commit -a --amend -m "$AUTOMAGIC_COMMIT_MESSAGE"

See <<commit-message,AUTOMAGIC -> commit message>>
for more information about the generated commit message.


ACTION: squash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Squash last git commit into previous one. Commit message of previous commit is
used.

This simple atomic action is a shortcut for

    git reset --soft HEAD~
    git commit --amend --no-edit

This is useful for squashing commits created by lower level actions such as
`update-patches`.


ACTION: get-sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download package source archive.

Currently, `Source0` from `.spec` file is downloaded.


ACTION: push-updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Push pending updates to repositories.

This **special** action is to be used on RDO repo box to push updated packages
to repos including download of built packages, signing and calling
`createrepo`.

Two positional arguemnts are required:

* `update-repo-path`: path to rdo-update git repo containing updates to push
* `dest-base`: destination path base

By default, all update files in `$UPDATE_REPO_PATH/ready/` are pushed. You can
override this by specifying update files to push using `-f`/`--files` argument
(relative to and residing in `update-repo-path`).

Each build contained in pushed update file is downloaded, signed and copied to
appropriate directory: `$DEST_BASE$REPO/$DIST/$TAG`

**protips:**

 * If you input incorrect passphrase, run `rdopkg -c` to try again.
 * You can force overwrite of existing packages by `-w`/`--overwrite`


ACTION: info
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Show information about RDO packaging.

Use this command to find out about:

 * currently supported RDO OpenStack releses
 * which distros are supported for each release
 * what branch to build from
 * what build system to build in
 * supported packages
 * various repositories tied to a package
 * package maintainers

This command is a human interface to <<rdoinfo,rdoinfo>>.

*Releases/dists/branches overview:*

    rdopkg info

*Detailed information about a package:*

    rdopkg info novaclient

*Filter packages by maintainers:*

    rdopkg info maintainers:jruzicka


ACTION: conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Display rdopkg's local configuration.

This command prints the default configuration that ships with rdopkg out of the
box. You can override the individual settings here by using `.py` files in the
configuration directories.

Store your per-user configuration in `~/.rdopkg/conf.d/*.py`, or store
system-wide configuration in `/etc/rdopkg.d/*.py`.

For example, to override `RDO_UPDATE_REPO`, place the following into
`~/.rdopkg/conf.d/rdoupdate-repo.py`:

    RDO_UPDATE_REPO="ssh://git@github.com/myaccount/rdo-update"


AUTOMAGIC
---------

Instead of requiring project config files or endless lists of command line
arguments, `rdopkg` tries to guess all the neccessary variables. 


[[patches-branch]]
patches branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`update-patches` is a core lower level action for updating dist-git `.spec`
file with patches from associated patches branch. `rdopkg` tries hard to
detect the patches branch automagically, it's usually `$BRANCH-patches` for
`$BRANCH` dist-git but one patches branch per multiple dist-gits is also
supported.

Best illustrated by example, following are all valid patches branches for
`rhos-5.0-rhel-7` dist-git and they're searched in that order:

 * rhos-5.0-rhel-7-patches
 * rhos-5.0-rhel-patches
 * **rhos-5.0-patches <--- preferred for RHOSP**
 * rhos-patches

Use `rdopkg pkgenv` to check detected patches branch.

You can specify remote patches branch by `-p`/`--patches-branch` action
parameter for actions that use it, such as `patch` and `new-version`.

Previously, now obsolete `update-patches.sh` script required `patches_base`
comment to be present in spec file which indicated git revision on top of
which the patches are applied but **this is now optional** with
`update-patches` action and defaults to .spec Version.

Most common use of `patches_base` is to specify number of patches on top of
patches base (which defaults to spec Version) to skip:

    # patches_base=+2

You can set an arbitrary git revision as a patches base:

    # patches_base=1.2.3+2

You shouldn't need to modify this by hand expect the number of skipped patches
as `rdopkg` manages `patches_base` as needed.


[[commit-message]]
commit message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Actions modifying dist-git generate commit message from %changelog.

First line of commit message is first line from latest %changelog entry.

If there are multiple lines in latest %changelog entry, entire entry is
listed in the commit message.

For each "(rhbz#XYZ)" mentioned in latest %changelog entry, "Resolves:
rhbz#XYZ" is appended to commit message as required by RHOSP workflow.

If you need to (re)generate commit message after modifying %changelog, use
**ACTION: amend**.

For example following %changelog entry:

    %changelog
    * Tue Feb 11 2014 Jakub Ruzicka <jruzicka@redhat.com> 0.5.1-2
    - Update to upstream 0.5.1
    - Fix evil Bug of Doom (rhbz#123456)

will generate following commit message:

    Update to upstream 0.5.1

    Resolves: rhbz#123456

    Changelog:
    - Update to upstream 0.5.1
    - Fix evil Bug of Doom (rhbz#123456)


[[rdoinfo]]
rdoinfo
~~~~~~~

`rdoinfo` is a special utility repository with RDO metadata:

https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo

`rdopkg` uses `rdoinfo` to

 * detect release/dist from branch name
 * check valid RDO updates
 * query packages from RDO/distribution repos

and more.

You can view the `rdoinfo` metada using `rdopkg info`.

`rdopkg.actionmods.rdoinfo` module provides convenient interface to `rdoinfo`
should you want to integrate it into your codez.
